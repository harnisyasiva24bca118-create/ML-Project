Behavior-Based Malware Detection using Machine Learning

A malware analysis project using dynamic behavioral features extracted from VirusShare samples

 Overview :

This project focuses on building a machine-learning–based behavior-driven malware detection system.
Instead of relying on traditional signature-based methods, this project extracts dynamic behavioral patterns from malware samples (VirusShare dataset) and uses ML models to classify files as malicious or benign.

 Note:
All malware samples used in this research were handled in a secure, isolated virtual environment (sandbox). Raw malware samples are not included in this repository for safety and legal reasons.

 Key Features :

✔ Dynamic behavioral analysis of malware

✔ Feature extraction from sandbox execution logs

✔ ML-based classification using multiple algorithms

✔ Data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation

✔ Visualizations of malware behavior patterns

✔ Reproducible workflow for research and academic use

 Dataset :

Source: VirusShare Malware Dataset

Type: Executables executed in a controlled analysis environment

Features collected:

API calls

Registry modifications

File system activity

Network activity

Process creation behavior

Runtime anomalies

 This repository does NOT contain malware binaries.

 Methodology :
1) Environment Setup

A sandbox (e.g., Cuckoo Sandbox, Any.Run, CAPEv2) was used to safely execute samples and capture behavioral logs.

2️) Feature Extraction

Behavioral events were parsed and converted into numerical feature vectors using:

Frequency-based API call vectors

TF-IDF–based technique on event sequences

One-hot encoding of behavioral categories

3️) Model Training

Various ML models were trained:

Random Forest

XGBoost

SVM

Logistic Regression

Neural Networks (optional)

4️) Evaluation Metrics

Accuracy

Precision, Recall, F1-score

ROC-AUC

Confusion matrix

 Results :

Key findings (replace with your actual results):

Model	Accuracy	F1-Score	AUC
Random Forest	94%	0.93	0.96
XGBoost	96%	0.95	0.98
SVM	91%	0.90	0.92
 Safety & Ethical Disclaimer

All testing was conducted in an isolated sandbox environment.

Do NOT download or execute malware samples unless you are trained and working in a secure environment.

This project is strictly for research and educational purposes.

Raw malware samples are NOT distributed here.
